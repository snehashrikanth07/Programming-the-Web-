# Programming-the-Web-

This repository contains two small static site folders you can preview locally:

- `Programming_the_web/` — a desktop site demo (HTML, CSS, image).
- `tea/` — a small tea-themed site (HTML, CSS, image).

How to preview locally

1. Open the folder you want to preview in your browser. For example, to view the tea site, open `tea/index.html` in your browser.

2. Or run a simple local static server from the repo root (Python 3):

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/tea/index.html or /Programming_the_web/index_desktop.html
```

If you'd like, I can add a nicer README, screenshots, or GitHub Pages config to publish the site live.
